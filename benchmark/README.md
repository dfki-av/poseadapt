# PoseAdapt Benchmark

## Overview

This directory contains benchmark data and configurations for evaluating continual learning strategies on pose estimation tasks using the PoseAdapt framework. The benchmarks are designed to assess the performance of various continual learning methods in adapting to new domains and keypoint configurations while retaining knowledge from previous tasks.

Please download the benchmark data from the provided link in README and place it in the `benchmark/data` directory.
